Cannot cast a value of type `Awaitable<string>` to string. Only primitives may be used in a `(string)` cast. (Typing[4281])
WARN: File "unused_awaitable14.php", line 9, characters 17-31:
Casting Awaitable<string> to string: casting a non-primitive type to a primitive rarely yields a useful value. Did you mean to extract a value from this object before casting it, or to do a null-check? (Warn[12005])
