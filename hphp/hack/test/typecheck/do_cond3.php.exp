WARN: File "do_cond3.php", line 14, characters 11-14:
This is a sketchy null check.
It detects nulls, but it will also detect many other falsy values, including `false`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `"0"`, empty Containers, and more.
If you want to test for them, please consider doing so explicitly.
If you only meant to test for `null`, use `$meh is null` instead (Warn[12003])
