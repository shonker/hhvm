WARN: File "if_non_null_this.php", line 15, characters 11-12:
This is a sketchy null check.
It detects nulls, but it will also detect many other falsy values, including `false`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `"0"`, empty Containers, and more.
If you want to test for them, please consider doing so explicitly.
If you only meant to test for `null`, use `$x is nonnull` instead (Warn[12003])
WARN: File "if_non_null_this.php", line 15, characters 11-12:
Sketchy condition: testing the truthiness of a string may not behave as expected.
The values `""` and `"0"` are both considered falsy. To check for emptiness, use `Str\is_empty`. (Warn[12006])
