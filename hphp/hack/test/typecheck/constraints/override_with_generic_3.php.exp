  Method `do` has type `(function<T>(): T where TEnt as IMyEnt with { type TC = T })` in `MyReified`

  Type `(function<T>(): T where TEnt as IMyEnt with { type TC = T })` is not a subtype of `(function(): Foo)`

  Expected a class with `{type TC = _}`
  File "override_with_generic_3.php", line 18, characters 36-39:
