The method `foo` is not compatible with the overridden method (Typing[4341])

  Method `foo` has type `(function<T as mixed as C>(): ~Action<T>)` in `C`

  But it has type `(function<T as mixed as B>(): ~Action<T>)` in parent `B`

  Type `(function<T as mixed as C>(): ~Action<T>)` is not a subtype of `(function<T as mixed as B>(): ~Action<T>)`

  `T` is a constrained type parameter

  This type constraint is violated
  File "constraint_override_bad2.php", line 20, characters 28-28:
  Expected `C`
  File "constraint_override_bad2.php", line 15, characters 41-41:
  But got `T as B`

  This type argument to `Action` only allows supertypes (it is contravariant)
