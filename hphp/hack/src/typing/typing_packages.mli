(** [can_access_public ~env ~current_module ~target_module target_pos] returns whether a symbol defined in

  * according to both module visibility rules and package dependency rules.
  * If package_v2 is set in [env], also check that the current file is allowed to access the
  * target file (calculated by [target_pos]) according to package v2 dependency rules. If
  * [target_package_override] is not None, its value takes precedence over that calculated from the target
  * file name.
