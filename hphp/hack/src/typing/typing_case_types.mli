(**
  A runtime data type describes the set of values that can carry a particular
  set of runtime tags. It is possible to map any type to a particular
  runtime data type, and based on this reason about if two types can possibly
  intersect.

type runtime_data_type

(**
  Maps a type hint to its associated runtime data type. This is intended to
  be used to only as part of checking if a case type is well-formed.
*)
val data_type_from_hint : env -> Aast.hint -> runtime_data_type

(**
  Checks if two different runtime data types can possibly overlap. Two
  runtime data types are considered to overlap if there exist a value at
  runtime that can belong to both data types. If no such value can exist then
  [None] is returned. Otherwise an error is produced that explains why the
  two runtime data types are considered to be overlapping.

(**
  Given the variants of a case type (encoded as a locl_ty) and another locl_ty [intersecting_ty]
  produce a new locl_ty containing only the types in the variant that map to an intersecting
  data type. For example:
    Given
     [variants] = int | vec<int> | Vector<int>
     [intersecting_ty] = Container<string>

    This function will return the type `vec<int> | Vector<int>` because both `vec<int>` and
   `Vector<int>` overlap with the tag associated with `Container<string>`.

   Note that this function only considers the data type associated to each type and not
   the type itself. So even though `vec<int>` and `Container<string>` do not intersect at
   the type level, they do intersect when considering only the runtime data types.

(**
   Look up case type via [name]. If the case type exist returns the list of
   variant types. If the case type doesn't exist, returns [None].
