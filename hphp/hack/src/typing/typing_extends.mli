(** [check_implements_extends_uses env ~implements ~parents type_]
    checks that a classish type implements its interfaces,
    extends its base class, and uses its traits.

  This actually only checks member compatibility. Other hierarchy
  checks like requirements (e.g. `require extends`) are checked
  in Typing_class.

  @param implements   the list of interfaces the classish type directly implements.
  @param parents      the list of direct ancestors, including interfaces and
                      traits, the class directly uses.
  @param type_        the classish type to check.
