  (** Abstract representation of a partition *)
  type t

  (** Operations on atoms are represented in disjunctive normal form (DNF).
      This means it is a list of disjunctions (unions) that contain
      a list of conjunctions (intersections).

  val mk_bottom : t

  (** A partition where the atom is assumed to be fully within the left side
     of the partition *)
  val mk_left : atom -> t

  (** A partition where the atom is assumed to be fully within the right side
     of the partition *)
  val mk_right : atom -> t

  (** A partition that spans across the left and right partitions *)
  val mk_span : atom -> t

  (** Unions two partitions together producing another partition *)
  val join : t -> t -> t

  (** Intersects two partitions together producing another partition *)
  val meet : t -> t -> t

  (** If the partition is fully within the left, span or right we can
     simplify the DNF to be just the given atom, otherwise return [t] unchanged
  *)

  (* Accessors *)

  (** Returns the component of the partition that
      is definitely within the left side of the partition *)
  val left : t -> dnf

  (** Returns the component of the partition that is definitely
      spans across the left and right side of the partition *)
  val span : t -> dnf

  (** Returns the component of the partition that
      is definitely within the right side of the partition *)
  val right : t -> dnf

  (** Given a product function from atoms to an atom and a list of partitions,
      Returns a new partition that is the "product" of the given partitions
      such that:
      A set in the new partition is a set obtained by taking one set from each
      given partition and combining them using the given product function.
      There is a set in the new partition for every such combination.
      Combinations of sets only from the left side of the input partitions are
      on the left of the new partition.
      Combinations of sets containing at least one set from the right side of
      an input partition are on the right of the new partition.
      All other combinations of sets are in the span of the new partition. *)
