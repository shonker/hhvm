(** istate, "initialized state", is the state the daemon after it has
finished initialization (i.e. finished loading saved state),
concerning these data-structures:
1. forward-naming-table-delta stored in naming_table
2. reverse-naming-table-delta-and-cache stored in local_memory
3. entries with source text, stored in open_files
3. cached ASTs and TASTs, stored in open_files
4. shallow-decl-cache, folded-decl-cache stored in local-memory

There are two concepts to understand.
1. "Singleton context" (ctx). When processing IDE requests for a file, we create
   a context object in which that entry's source text and AST and TAST
   are present in the context, and no others are.
2. "Quarantine with respect to an entry". We enter a quarantine while
   computing the TAST for a singleton context entry. The invariants within
   the quarantine are different from those without.

The key algorithms which read from these data-structures are:
1. Ast_provider.get_ast will fetch the cached AST for an entry in ctx, or if
   the entry is present but as yet lacks an AST then it will parse and cache,
   or if it's lookinng for the AST of a file not in ctx then it will parse
   off disk but decline to cache.
2. Naming_provider.get_* will get_ast for ctx entry to see if symbol is there.
   If not it will look in reverse-delta-and-cache or read from sqlite
   and store the answer back in reverse-delta-and-cache. But if the answer
   to that fallback was a file in ctx, then it will say that the symbol's
   not defined.
3. Decl_provider.get_shallow_class_* will look it up in shallow-decl-cache, and otherwise
   will ask Naming_provider and Ast_provider for the AST, will compute shallow decl,
   and will store it in shallow-decl-cache
4. Decl_provider.get_* will look it up in folded-decl-cache, computing it if
   not there using shallow provider, and store it back in folded-decl-cache
5. Tast_provider.compute* is only ever called on entries. It returns the cached
   TAST if present; otherwise, it runs normal type-checking-and-inference, relies
   upon all the other providers, and writes the answer back in the entry's TAST cache.

The invariants for forward and reverse naming tables:
1. These tables only ever reflect truth about disk files; they are unaffected
   by open_file entries.
2. They are updated in response to DidChangeWatchedFileEvents.
   Because watchman and VSCode send those events asynchronously,
   we might for instance find ourselves being asked to compute a TAST
   by reading the naming-table and fetching a shallow-decl from a file
   that doesn't even exist on disk any more (even though we don't yet know it).

The invariants for AST, TAST, shallow, and folded-decl caches:
1. AST, if present, reflects the AST of its entry's source text,
   and is a "full" AST (not decl-only), and has errors.
2. TAST, if present, reflects the TAST of its entry's source text computed
   against the on-disk state of all other files
3. Outside a quarantine, all entries in shallow cache are correct as of disk
   (at least as far as asynchronous file updates have been processed).
4. Likewise, all entries in folded caches are correct as of disk.
5. We only ever enter quarantine with respect to one single entry.
   For the duration of the quarantine, an AST for that entry,
   if present, is correct as of the entry's source text.
6. Likewise any shallow decls for an entry are correct as of its source text.
   Moreover, if shallow decls for an entry are present, then the entry's AST
   is present and contains those symbols.
7. Any shallow decls not for the entry are correct as of disk.
8. During quarantine, the shallow-decl of all other files is correct as of disk.
9. The entry's TAST, along with every single decl,
   are correct as of this entry's source text plus every other file off disk.

Here are the algorithms we use that satisfy those invariants.
1. Upon a disk-file-change, we invalidate all TASTs (satisfying invariant 2).
   We use the forward-naming-table to find all "old" symbols that were
   defined in the file prior to the disk change, and invalidate those
   shallow decls (satisfying invariant 3). We invalidate all
   folded caches (satisfying invariant 4). Invariant 1 is N/A.
2. Upon an editor change to a file, we invalidate the entry's AST and TAST
   (satisfying invariant 1).
3. Upon request for a TAST of a file, we create a singleton context for
   that entry, and enter quarantine as follows. We parse the file and
   cache its AST and invalidate shallow decls for all symbols inside
   this new AST (satisfying invariant 6). We invalidate all decls
   (satisfying invariant 9). Subsequent fetches,
   thanks to the "key algorithms for reading these datastructures" (above)
   will only cache things in accordance with invariants 6,7,8,9.
4. We leave quarantine as follows. We invalidate shallow decls for
   all symbols in the entry's AST; thanks to invariant 5, this will
   fulfill invariant 3. We invalidate all decls (satisfying invariant 4).

others. Important: files may change during [During_init], and it's important that we keep track of and eventually index these changed files.
