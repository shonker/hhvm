// rocket_frame_parser flag specify which frame parser rocket transport decide
// to use. It can take three values
// - "strategy": rocket transport will use FrameLengthParserStrategy to parse
// rocket frames. This parsing strategy reads the rocket frame length (first 3
// bytes) and immediately hands off frames to downstream as soon as a full frame
// is available.
// - "allocating": frame parser that can take a custom allocator, we also
// guarantee buffer returned are not chained (meaning continuous). This can
// provide performance benefits when using cursor-based serialization.
