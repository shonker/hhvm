  This template calculates the Go qualified name of
  a typedefed enum. This can be one of two cases:

  1. This is a simple typedef to enum, so the name is

     enum_go_qualified_name

  2. This is a typedef to a typedef (to an enum) so the name is:

     #type_typedef typedef_go_qualified_name /type_typedef

  This was #2 is using the qual. name of the typedefs' type which is
  also a typedef.
